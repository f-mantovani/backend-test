Based on the FAO's definition of the population at risk of hunger (Cafiero, 2014) and in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, which aims to achieve universal food and nutrition security by 2030, FABLE sets a target for average daily energy intake per capita that exceeds the MDER in each listed country and region by 2030. The MDER represents the minimum caloric intake required for good health, varying by age, sex, and activity level.</p>\n            <br />\n            <p>While this target does not address food access inequalities within countries, it provides a clear and measurable benchmark for assessing progress toward global food security.</p>"
