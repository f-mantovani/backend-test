    Annual GHG emissions from crops and livestock.
    => The visual pattern seems to be the same
    => All the values don't match with what's displayed on the website
        (sum of CalcAllAgriCO2e for all the countries in the same year)
    => Seems that India is being added to the values in the AFTER,
        but we only have the values for the BEFORE.

    Average annual GHG emissions from land use change and peat oxidation.
    => Couldn't figure out how to get the values.
